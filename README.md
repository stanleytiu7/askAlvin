# Ask Alvin
Inspired by Alvin and his incredible abilities for recommending great places to eat around New York City,
we decided to work on this project during the 4 day 'stack'-a-thon that FSA holds.

### Technologies Used:

- [ ] React-Redux with materialize
- [ ] Node.js
- [ ] Express.js
- [ ] Postgresql
- [ ] Google Places API
- [ ] React Google Maps (adapted for own use)
- [ ] External Fullstack Academy API

### These are what I want to yield from doing this project.

- [ ] Get the Best Pizza, Hamburger, Icecream, Taco, Pho, Bar Places in New York City from recommendations of classmates
- [ ] Never stop and stand on the streets looking at your phone and Yelp for endless time.
- [ ] Better Social Time with people in FullStack Academy.
- [ ] Better Lunch at FullStack Academy.
- [ ] Better MealPal experience
- [ ] Help the following Cohort people who are new in town.

### User Experience
- [ ] Recommend restaurants
- [ ] Remove own recommendations
- [ ] See recommendations from others (different color)
- [ ] See information about the person who recommended the restaurant
- [ ] Sign in using Fullstack Academy account (externally verified)

### These are features we think will make this project a little bit greater.

- [ ] Voting System or Battle System.
- [ ] Get track of recommendations by each person.
- [ ] List people who recommended and restaurants by that person.
- [ ] The recommenders and message should pop up over the google map.
- [ ] Level up system for eating or recommending restaurants
- [ ] A pull into Fullstack Academy's internal site for future cohort use
